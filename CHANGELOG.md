## [v2.2] - 2025-09-19

**Added:**

- Added a social preview banner image to [`README.md`](https://github.com/dileepadev/community-standards/blob/main/README.md) using Markdown syntax.

**Changed:**

- Fixed checklist formatting examples in the [feature request issue template](<https://github.com/dileepadev/community-standards/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md>) to render correctly in GitHub UI.

## [v2.1] - 2025-09-16

**Added:**

- Introduced [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/dileepadev/community-standards/blob/main/AGENTS.md) at repo root (or appropriate location) to cover:
  - Project overview for AI/code agents
  - Setup steps (dependencies, build)
  - Test/run instructions
  - Code style & commit/pull request expectations
  - Security, environment, and any “gotchas”

  Note: This file ([`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/dileepadev/community-standards/blob/main/AGENTS.md)) provides instructions and conventions specifically for AI coding agents. It includes things like build/test commands, code style, environment setup, and pull‑request/commit rules so that any automation or agent has a clear, predictable source of how to operate in the repo.

- Improved example clarity in the following documentation files:
  - [`BRANCH_NAMING_GUIDELINES.md`](https://github.com/dileepadev/community-standards/blob/main/BRANCH_NAMING_GUIDELINES.md)

  - [`README.md`](https://github.com/dileepadev/community-standards/blob/main/README.md)

- Updated the below files:
  - [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/dileepadev/community-standards/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
